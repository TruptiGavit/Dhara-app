He is also known for capturing twelve thousand kings and performing rituals at Kurukṣetra to honor his parents [11], reclaiming land from the sea by convincing Varuṇa to withdraw his waters and restore the holy spot of Gokarṇa for the sages [12], and eulogizing the Supreme Lord while seeking blessings from deities including Śiva, Pārvatī, and Kṛṣṇa [13].
